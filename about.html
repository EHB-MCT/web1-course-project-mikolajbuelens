        <h2>So, who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Well as you might have guessed I'm Mikolaj (yup, a Polish name), as
          I'm making this website I'm 22 years old and in my first year of
          Multimedia & creative technology. I have a passion for computers,
          programming, graphic design, 3D and technology in general. My interest
          in these topics began at a young age when I first started playing
          video games around the year 2006. Besides the fun and relaxation I got
          out of them I also found something deeper, an appreciation for both
          the creative and technical aspect of said video games, being born
          right in time to see the rapid progress in graphics, size and details
          that were achieved were amazing. From grass to entire forests,
          character, interfaces,... the list goes on and on. And to realize that
          all these concepts were programmed by people that worked tirelessly on
          them is nothing short of amazing to me. You can of course extend this
          to other media like movies where CGI can make or break a scene.
          Whether I'll be evolving towards the gaming industry in terms of
          future work is an uncertainty, as it's not an easy sector to be a part
          of, combine that with the fact that Belgium isn't exactly a market
          leader in gaming and you got yourself a guy making a website right
          now.

        <h2>My programming journey</h2>
        <p>
          My struggle with learning to program has led me to a path of learning,
          I'm someone that, if committed to something (in this case learning
          HTML, CSS, Javascript) wants to be good at it from the get-go but and
          as anyone who programmes will likely tell you, it's not something you
          can learn on a couple of days. Just like you would't be able to learn
          to speak fluent Chinese in a short amount of time. Now combine that
          with me being both a perfectionist and not having the patience when a
          computer doesn't do what I want it to and you might understand why my
          early days of programming weren't the most enjoyable. However, as time
          went by and I started to practice more and more (kinda had to if I
          wanted to pass my year) and reading a lot (documentation and tips from
          people more experienced than me) I found that instead of being a chore
          that I <strong>had</strong> to do, programming became more and more of
          a fun hobby to the point that I wanted to do it just for the fun of
          it. And well here I am making this website not because I feel an
          obligation but because I like doing it. The thing that I learned the
          most trough all this, as absolutely cliché as it may sound: Failure is
          part of life, everyone faces it, but if you keep going, you'll get
          there...
