          Well as you might have guessed I'm Mikolaj (yup, a Polish name), as
          I'm making this website I'm 22 years old and in my first year of
          Multimedia & creative technology. I have a passion for computers,
          programming, graphic design, 3D and technology in general. My interest
          in these topics began at a young age when I first started playing
          video games around the year 2006. Besides the fun and relaxation I got
          out of them I also found something deeper, an appreciation for both
          the creative and technical aspects of said video games. Being born
          right in time to see the rapid progress in graphics, size and details
          that were achieved was fascinating. From making grass to entire
          forests, character, interfaces,... the list goes on and on. And to
          realize that all these concepts were programmed and designed by people
          that worked tirelessly on them is nothing short of amazing to me. You
          can of course extend this to a bunch of other media like movies, where
          CGI can make or break a scene. Whether I'll be evolving towards the
          gaming industry in terms of future work is an uncertainty, as it's not
          an easy sector to be a part of, combine that with the fact that
          Belgium isn't exactly a market leader in gaming and you got yourself a
          guy that is making a website right now.

        <h2>My programming journey</h2>
        <p>
          My struggle with learning to program has led me through a path of
          learning. I'm someone that, if committed to something (in this case
          learning HTML, CSS, Javascript) wants to be good at it from the get-go
          but as anyone who has some experience will likely tell you, it's not
          something you can just learn on a couple of days. Just like you
          would't be able to learn to speak fluent Chinese in a short amount of
          time. Now combine that with me being both a perfectionist and not
          having the patience when a computer doesn't do what I want it to and
          you might understand why my early days of programming weren't the most
          enjoyable. However, as time went by and I started to practice more and
          more (kinda had to if I wanted to pass my year) and reading a lot
          (documentation and tips from people more experienced than me) I found
          that instead of being a chore that I <strong>had</strong> to do,
          programming became more and more of a fun hobby to the point that I
          wanted to do it just for the fun of it. And well here I am making this
          website not because I feel an obligation but because I like doing it.
          As <strong>absolutely</strong> clich√© as it may sound: at the end of
          the day failure is a part of life, everyone faces it, but if you keep
          going, you'll get there...
